MERN Stack comprises of 4 technologies namely: MongoDB, Express, React and NodeJS. It is designed to make the development process smoother and easier.The MERN Stack is a combination of four open-source technologies—MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. This stack is designed for building modern web applications using JavaScript at every level, providing a seamless development experience from front-end to back-end.The MERN Stack is an excellent choice for developers looking to build modern, scalable, and high-performing web applications using a single language – JavaScript. With a fast learning curve, real-time capabilities, and strong community support, MERN is one of the most sought-after stacks for web development.</p>
